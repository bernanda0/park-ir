This project aims to address parking management challenges by leveraging innovative IoT solutions. The primary focus is on utilizing the ESP32 as the central control unit, Infrared technology for seamless entry and exit detection, LoRa for robust connectivity, and a systematic backend system. The integration of additional features like LEDs for confirmation and a servo-controlled gate adds to the project's convenience and functionality.
